			<h3>About</h3>
			<div id="aboutPage"><p>This web application was created to stream line the process of creating a CSV file to use with the bulk uploader HistoryPin.org function.  http://www.historypin.org/bulkbridge/
			<p>This application stores data locally on the device you are using to access it. It does not store the photos in the CSV file.</p>
 			<p>The intended workflow would be to organize your historical photos in an accessible location. Select each photo you know the location for and then select the location and store the data in the application. Continue adding photos until complete. You can shut the application down and come back if you have many photos. Data is stored locally on your device used (computer, phone, laptop) until you hit the ‘clear data’ button. After you download the CSV file you can import it into the CSV template from the HistoryPin website and fill out the ancillary data. From there go to the HistoryPin.org bulk uploader page and follow the instructions there to upload your photos and CSV. </p>
